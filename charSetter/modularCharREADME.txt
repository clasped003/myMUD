THIS PROGRAM IS SERVING AS THE INITIAL DRAFT OF WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PROFILE CREATION PROGRAM.
IT WILL HAVE A MAIN FUNCTION (WHICH BECOMES A VOID IF CONNECTED TO ANOTHER PROGRAM) THAT HOLDS 
A HEADER FILE INCLUDE TO A CHARACTER HEADER FILE. FROM THAT CHARACTER HEADER FILE,
THE VARIABLES IN IT GET FILLED BY THE FUNCTIONS LISTED IN THE MAIN FUNCTION. 
THOSE FUNCTIONS WILL BE IN SEPARATE SOURCE FILES, THAT FEED THE RESULTS INTO
POINTERS THAT WERE FED IN AS FUNCTION PARAMETERS.
