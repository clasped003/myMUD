# myMUD
A Multi-User Dungeon project written in C

This is a project to create a first draft of a Multi-User Dungeon. It will be a simple first iteration.
It will include a basic menu, the ability to name a character and to wander around a few rooms in a building, maybe even go to an alley.
It is mostly being done to test the basic functions of the intro portions of a game.
A new project will be made in the future that will include interactive objects and possibly an NPC or two.
The iteration after that will possibly include a battle system!
